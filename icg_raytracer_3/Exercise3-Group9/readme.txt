**Task 3.1.1: Compute triangle normals and opening angles**

We used vec3 substract and angle methode to first compute the vectors between the vertices and then the corresponding angles. 
The normal was obtained by a cross product of two of those vectors.

**Task 3.1.2: Compute vertex normals**

We added the contribution of each faces to each vertex linked to that triangles weighted by the openning angle.
Our very first version had the right "idea" but because of broken arithmetic with js and vec3 we had weird results.
We spent hours trying to understand where the bug was coming from, reading our code again and again.
We did as much version of the same computation as we could imagine, until this one which apparently is finally fully correctly undertsood. 

**Task 3.2.1: Implement ray-triangle intersection**

To implement the ray-triangle intersection, we had to solve the equation 'o+td = alpha*A+beta*B+gamma*C' with the constraints 'alpha+beta+gamma = 1' and 'alpha,beta,gamma>=0'coming from the barycentric coordinates. 
As suggested in the question, we decided to solve it using Cramer's rule. Therefore, we first had to transform the equation above in the form 'Ax = b' where x is the vector with the 3 unknowns (i.e. alpha, beta and t). To be able to use Cramer's rule, we also needed a method to compute the determinant of a matrix, which we implemented by using the mixed product between the 3 columns of the matrix. Then to implement Cramer's rule, we first computed the determinant of A. If it was equal (close since we use floats) to 0, it doesn't have a unique solution, so we return and otherwise we compute alpha, gamma and t by replacing the corresponding column of A with b, computing the determinant of this new matrix and dividing by the determinant of A.

After having solved the equation, we check that t is bigger or equal to 0, so that the intersection happens in front of the viewer. We then compute gamma using the first constraint from above and check that the 3 values are bigger or equal to 0 (second constraint). If everything holds, we have an intersection, otherwise not.

**Task 3.2.2: Implement flat and Phong shading strategies**

To implement flat and Phong shading, we just had to first chech which mode was used (#if defined). Then we computed the normal either by taking the cross product between two side of the triangle (which will give the vector perpendicular to both sides, i.e. the normal) and normalizing it in case of flat shading, or by adding the 3 vertex normals using alpha, beta and gamma as weights in case of Phong shading.

The level of reflexion is set to 2 for every screenshot we took.
