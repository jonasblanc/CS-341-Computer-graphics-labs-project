** Task 2.1: 1D noise **
We compute the different valeus as shown in the handout. For the gradients, since we're in 1d we use gradients(hash_func(vec2(c_0,0.))).x. The hash_func takes a vec two, so we augment the c_0 and c_1 into vec2's with 0 as the second value.  And we only take the first value of the gradient that we get (gradients.x)
