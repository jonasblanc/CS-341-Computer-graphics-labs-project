# ICG Exercise 4 - Geometric transforms in the GPU pipeline
[Handout](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonasblanc/ComputerGraphicProject/blob/master/icg_exercise_4/exercise4.html)

In this exercise we change the rendering pipeline from the iterative ray tracing model in previous labs to rasterization to be able to do parallel computing in the GPU. We start getting familiar with geometric transformations by rendering a basic 2D scene. Then move to a more complexe scene representing the solar system with the sun, the earth, the moon and mars.

[Here](./report/README.md) is a summary of the executed tasks in this lab.

Here are some screenshots from the final scene:
