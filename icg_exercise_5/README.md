# ICG Exercise 5 â€“ Texturing and Lighting
[Handout](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonasblanc/ComputerGraphicProject/blob/master/icg_exercise_5/exercise5.html)

In this exercise, we improve the solar sytsem of the previous lab by adding lighting and texture. We first create a halo around the Sun by placing a plane perpendicular to the camera cutting the sun in two halves. We decrease the opacity of the plane proportionally to the distance to the center of the sun. Once again we implement the phong shading model to illuminate the planets. Then we add different textures for the Earth on day and night. Finally we had to add a customly made mesh generated in blender.

[Here](./report/README.md) is a summary of the executed tasks in this lab.
