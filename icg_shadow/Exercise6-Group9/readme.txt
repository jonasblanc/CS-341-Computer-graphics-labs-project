**TASK 6.1.0 Copy from Your Last Homework**

**TASK 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 Construct Transformation Matrix for Shadow Mapping**

To construct the cube_camera_projection matrix, we used the method perspective. 
For the arguments, we gave pi/2 for the fovy since we are in the middle of a cube and the fovy represent half of the total angle. 
For the ratio, we used 1 since a cube has the same height and width. 
Finally, we used 0.1 and 100 as values for near and far, which serve as boundaries for the distance at which we compute the shadow ray intersections.


We did a switch on the different cube faces to set the up and lookTo vector (as in fig. 2).
Then we get the light position in the camera coordinates. 
At first we didn't saw the the icg_math.js file so we did the computation component by component which took quite some time.
Then to get the point we want to look to we add the light position and the lookTo vector.
(Both are in camera coordinates.)
The function lookAt take "up" as a vector so we don't need to add the position to the up vector.
Finally we first multiply by scene_view to be ine the camera coordinates and then multiply by the lookAt matrix which is defined in camera coordinates.

**TASK 6.2.1: Light Depth Fragment Shader**
To compute the Euclidean Distance,  we use the length function. 

**TASK 6.2.2: Phong Lighting Shader with Shadows**

We divided light_color by the squarre of the distance before using it in the specular and diffuse calculation.
We added a global "if" in order to disregard vertices that are not the closest ones to the light source.

**TASK 6.2.3 Blend Options**

To implement the blending, we just decided to use the add functionnality in the equation (which is not really useful since it is set by default, but it looks clearer like this). Therefore, both colors will be added. We used a constant color with a factor of 1 so that both colors are fully taken into account.
