**TASK 6.1.0 Copy from Your Last Homework**

**TASK 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 Construct Transformation Matrix for Shadow Mapping**

**TASK 6.2.1: Light Depth Fragment Shader**
To compute the Euclidean Distance,  we use the length function. 

**TASK 6.2.2: Phong Lighting Shader with Shadows**

**TASK 6.2.3 Blend Options**

To implement the blending, we just decided to use the add functionnality in the equation (which is not really useful since it is set by default, but it looks clearer like this). Therefore, both colors will be added. We used a constant color with a factor of 1 so that both colors are fully taken into account.
