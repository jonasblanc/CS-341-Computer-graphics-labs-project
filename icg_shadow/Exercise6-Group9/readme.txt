**TASK 6.1.0 Copy from Your Last Homework**

For this part, we just copied our code from last week and adapted it a bit. We translated our view center by cam_target and computed the light and view vectors.

**TASK 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 Construct Transformation Matrix for Shadow Mapping**

To construct the cube_camera_projection matrix, we used the method perspective. For the arguments, we gave pi/2 for the fovy since we are in the middle of a cube and the fovy represent half of the total angle. For the ratio, we used 1 since a cube has the same height and width. Finally, we used 0.1 and 100 as values for near and far, which serve as boundaries for the distance at which we compute the shadow ray intersections.



**TASK 6.2.1: Light Depth Fragment Shader**
To compute the Euclidean Distance,  we use the length function. 

**TASK 6.2.2: Phong Lighting Shader with Shadows**

**TASK 6.2.3 Blend Options**

To implement the blending, we just decided to use the add functionnality in the equation (which is not really useful since it is set by default, but it looks clearer like this). Therefore, both colors will be added. We used a constant color with a factor of 1 so that both colors are fully taken into account.
